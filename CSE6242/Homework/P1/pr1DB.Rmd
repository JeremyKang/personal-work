_Note: This project involves getting data ready for analysis and doing some preliminary investigations. Project 2 will involve modeling and predictions, and will be released at a later date. Both projects will have equal weightage towards your grade._

# Data

In this project, you will explore a dataset that contains information about movies, including ratings, budget, gross revenue and other attributes. It was prepared by Dr. Guy Lebanon, and here is his description of the dataset:

> The file [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) contains a dataframe with the same name that has 40K rows and 39 columns. Each row represents a movie title and each column represents a descriptor such as `Title`, `Actors`, and `Budget`. I collected the data by querying IMDb’s API (see [www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) and joining it with a separate dataset of movie budgets and gross earnings (unknown to you). The join key was the movie title. This data is available for personal use, but IMDb’s terms of service do not allow it to be used for commercial purposes or for creating a competing repository.

# Objective

Your goal is to investigate the relationship between the movie descriptors and the box office success of movies, as represented by the variable `Gross`. This task is extremely important as it can help a studio decide which titles to fund for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release a title, how much to invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information is most useful before a title is released, but it is still very valuable after the movie is already released to the public (for example it can affect additional marketing spend or how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for “second window” streaming rights).

# Instructions
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Open this file in RStudio to get started.

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x = 1:10
print(x^2)
```

Plots appear inline too:
```{r}
plot(x, x^2, 'o')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Please complete the tasks below and submit this R Markdown file (as **pr1.Rmd**) as well as a PDF export of it (as **pr1.pdf**). Both should contain all the code, output, plots and written responses for each task.

# Setup

## Load data

Make sure you've downloaded the [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) file and it is in the current working directory. Now load it into memory:

```{r}
load('movies_merged')
```

This creates an object of the same name (`movies_merged`). For convenience, you can copy it to `df` and start using it:

```{r}
df = movies_merged
cat("Dataset has", dim(df)[1], "rows and", dim(df)[2], "columns", end="\n", file="")
colnames(df)
```

## Load R packages

Load any R packages that you will need to use. You can come back to this chunk, edit it and re-run to load any additional packages later.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(devtools)
library(robustHD)
library(data.table)
library(lubridate)
library(grid)
library(corrplot)
```

If you are loading any non-standard packages (ones that have not been discussed in class or explicitly allowed for this project), please mention them below. Include any special instructions if they cannot be installed using the regular `install.packages('<pkg name>')` command.

**Non-standard packages used**: reshape2, plyr, tidyr, stringr, devtools, robustHD

# Tasks

Each task below is worth **10** points, and is meant to be performed sequentially, i.e. do step 2 after you have processed the data as described in step 1. Total points: **100**

Complete each task by implementing code chunks as described by `TODO` comments, and by responding to questions ("**Q**:") with written answers ("**A**:"). If you are unable to find a meaningful or strong relationship in any of the cases when requested, explain why not by referring to appropriate plots/statistics.

It is OK to handle missing values below by omission, but please omit as little as possible. It is worthwhile to invest in reusable and clear code as you may need to use it or modify it in project 2.

## 1. Remove non-movie rows

The variable `Type` captures whether the row is a movie, a TV series, or a game. Remove all rows from `df` that do not correspond to movies.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove all rows from df that do not correspond to movies
glimpse(df)
unique(df$Type)
df <- subset(df, df$Type == 'movie')
unique(df$Type)
dim(df)[1]
cat("The movies_merged dataset now has", dim(df)[1], "rows after removing series and game types.")
```

**Q**: How many rows are left after removal? _Enter your response below._

**A**: There are 40,000 observations left after removal of rows that were not movies. 

## 2. Process `Runtime` column

The variable `Runtime` represents the length of the title as a string. Write R code to convert it to a numeric value (in minutes) and replace `df$Runtime` with the new numeric column.

```{r}
# TODO: Replace df$Runtime with a numeric column containing the runtime in minutes
#testingSub <- sub("[1:9] h")


convert_Runtime = function(dfcol) {
  mins = vector(mode="numeric", length=length(df$Runtime))
  for (i in 1:length(dfcol)) {
    if (dfcol[i] == 'N/A') {
      mins[[i]] = NA
    } else if (grepl('h', dfcol[i])) {
        hr_ind = unlist(gregexpr('h', dfcol[i]))
        hr = as.numeric(substr(dfcol[i], 1, hr_ind - 1))
        min_ind = unlist(gregexpr('min', dfcol[i]))
        min = as.numeric(substr(dfcol[i], hr_ind + 1, min_ind - 1))
        mins[[i]] = (hr * 60) + min
    } else {
        min_ind = unlist(gregexpr('min', dfcol[i]))
        mins[[i]] = as.numeric(substr(dfcol[i], 1, min_ind - 1))
    }
  }
  return(mins)
}

unique(df$Runtime)

df$Runtime <- convert_Runtime(df$Runtime)

summary(df$Runtime)
```

Now investigate the distribution of `Runtime` values and how it changes over years (variable `Year`, which you can bucket into decades) and in relation to the budget (variable `Budget`). Include any plots that illustrate.

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate the distribution of Runtime values and how it varies by Year and Budget
mean(df$Runtime[df$Year >= 1888 & df$Year < 1928], na.rm=TRUE)
mean(df$Runtime[df$Year >= 1928 & df$Year < 1968], na.rm=TRUE)
mean(df$Runtime[df$Year >= 1960 & df$Year < 1980], na.rm=TRUE)
mean(df$Runtime[df$Year >= 1980 & df$Year < 2000], na.rm=TRUE)

#Boxplots of Runtime by Year
df$YearRange = cut(df$Year, seq(1880, 2018, by=10), dig.lab=4)

ggplot(df, aes(YearRange, Runtime, fill=YearRange)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +

#Boxplots of Runtime by Budget
df$BudgetRange = cut(df$Budget, c(quantile(df$Budget, probs = seq(0, 1, by=0.25),
                                   na.rm=TRUE, include.lowest=TRUE, right=TRUE)),
                     dig.lab=10)


ggplot(df, aes(BudgetRange, Runtime, fill=BudgetRange)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Total Runtime of Movies by Budget",
       x="Budget",
       y="Runtime")


#Trial and error below

# RuntimeofmaxBudget <- df$Runtime[df$Budget == max(df$Budget, na.rm=TRUE)]
# max(df$Budget, na.rm=TRUE)
# which(RuntimeofmaxBudget != NA)
```

_Feel free to insert additional code chunks as necessary._

**Q**: Comment on the distribution as well as relationships. Are there any patterns or trends that you can observe?

**A**: 

<!-- Average runtime is 80.25 minutes. After looking at the data, it seems that a few outliers (e.g., Resan (1987) with 873 minutes) could be pulling the distribution towards the right. -->

<!-- Runtimes seem to exponentially increase during the 1920's. From the oldest movie (1888) to 1928 (a 40 year range), the average runtime was 31.93 minutes. The average runtime of movies during the 40 years after 1928 was 68.49 minutes, a more than 210% increase in runtime. Interestingly, the runtime totals continue to exponentially increase (which is most likely due to an increase in the number of movies per year), but the total runtime decreases abruptly in the early 2000's. -->

<!-- The movie with the highest budget was Avatar (2009) with a runtime of 162 minutes and a budget of $425,000,000. The distribution has a slight positive skew using the raw budget and runtime numbers. Even after using a power transformation on Runtime, Budget, and Runtime and Budget, the best distribution was found to also have a positive skew. -->

## 3. Encode `Genre` column

The column `Genre` represents a list of genres associated with the movie in a string format. Write code to parse each text string into a binary vector with 1s representing the presence of a genre and 0s the absence, and add it to the dataframe as additional columns. Then remove the original `Genre` column.

For example, if there are a total of 3 genres: Drama, Comedy, and Action, a movie that is both Action and Comedy should be represented by a binary vector <0, 1, 1>. Note that you need to first compile a dictionary of all possible genres and then figure out which movie has which genres (you can use the R `tm` package to create the dictionary).

```{r}
# TODO: Replace Genre with a collection of binary columns
#Look into tidyr::gather (column names are values) and tidyr::spread (values in a column should be variables/column names)

unique(df$Genre)
genreDF <- unlist(strsplit(df$Genre, ','))
genreDF <- gsub(" ", "", genreDF)
genres <- c(unique(genreDF))
genres <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", genres)
genres

# 

# unique(df$Genre)
# #df <- spread(df, Genre, UniqueGenres, convert=TRUE, sep=" ")
# df3 <- separate(df, Genre, genres, sep=", ", extra="merge")
# df3[df3[6:34=='NA']] <- 0
# #df <- df[,!c(genresCol)]
# 
# #NEXT THING: CONVERT GENRE COLUMNS WITH VALUES TO 1, NA'S TO 0
# which(colnames(df) == "Documentary")
# which(colnames(df) == "Game-Show")
# 
# dfTest <- as.data.table(df)
# dfTest2 <- df
# dfTest[is.na(dfTest2[[,6:34]])] <- 0
# 
# dfTest[6:34] <- lapply(data, function(x) {
#                         gsub(NA, 0, dfTest[6:34])
# })
# 
# head(dfTest2[,6:34])
# dfTest2[,6:34][dfTest2[,6:34] == NA] <- 0
# head(dfTest2[6])
# #df$UniqueGenres <- gsub(",", "", df$Genre)
# #df$UniqueGenres = gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", df$UniqueGenres)
# #df$UniqueGenres[1]

#Maybe try str_replace() to replace column detect value, then add 1
# # Search for string in vector
# > str_detect(friends, "Alice")
# [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE
# # Replace string in vector
# > str_replace(friends, "Alice", "David")
# [1] "Sarah" "Tom"   "David"

# #df3SpreadTest <- separate(df3SpreadTest, GenreBV, genresPuncRemoved, fill = "right", convert=TRUE, drop=FALSE, sep=" ")
# unique(df3SpreadTest$Genre)


df3Test <- df
df3Test$GenreBV <- gsub(" ", "", df3Test$Genre) 
df3Test$GenreBV <- gsub(",", " ", df3Test$GenreBV)
df3Test$GenreBV <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", df3Test$GenreBV)

genreDfTesting$Rank <- seq(1:nrow(genreDfTesting))
#genreDfTesting$Rank2 <- sprintf("%02d", genreDfTesting$Rank)
row.names(genreDfTesting) = NULL

```

Plot the relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Select movies from top 10 most common genres and plot their relative proportions
ggplot(genreDfTesting, aes(reorder(Genre, Percent_movie), Percent_movie, fill=Genre)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", show.legend=FALSE) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(Percent_movie*100, 1))) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Proportion of Movies by Genre",
       x="Movie Genres",
       y="Proportion of Movies")
```

Examine how the distribution of `Runtime` changes across genres for the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Plot Runtime distribution for top 10 most common genres
top10Genres <- as.vector(genreDfTesting$Genre[1:10])
head(df3FinalDF[top10Genres])

#Get Top10Genres as a variable
#If cell is a top 10 genres and 1 is present in column, add rank to column Top10Genre
dfpt3T10Genres <- melt(data.frame(Runtime=df3FinalDF$Runtime, df3FinalDF[top10Genres]), measure=2:11)
removeZeros <- dfpt3T10Genres$value == 1
dfpt3T10Genres <- dfpt3T10Genres[removeZeros,]

#dfpt3T10Genres$value <- dfpt3T10Genres$value[dfpt3T10Genres$value == 1]


ggplot(dfpt3T10Genres, aes(variable, Runtime, fill=variable)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Runtime Distribution of Top 10 Most Common Genres",
       x="Genre",
       y="Runtime")


```

**Q**: Describe the interesting relationship(s) you observe. Are there any expected or unexpected trends that are evident?

**A**: 

## 4. Eliminate mismatched rows

The dataframe was put together by merging two different sources of data and it is possible that the merging process was inaccurate in some cases (the merge was done based on movie title, but there are cases of different movies with the same title). The first source’s release time was represented by the column `Year` (numeric representation of the year) and the second by the column `Released` (string representation of release date).

Find and remove all rows where you suspect a merge error occurred based on a mismatch between these two variables. To make sure subsequent analysis and modeling work well, avoid removing more than 10% of the rows that have a `Gross` value present.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove rows with Released-Year mismatch
summary(df3FinalDF$Year)
summary(df3FinalDF$Released)
class(df3FinalDF$Year)
class(df3FinalDF$Released)

Original_gross_present <- as.numeric(nrow(df3FinalDF) - summary(df3FinalDF$Gross)[7])

#Extract just Year and make new column for year disrepancies
df3FinalDF$YearReleased <- as.numeric(year(df3FinalDF$Released))
df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy1 <- vector(mode="character", length=length(df3FinalDF$Year))
df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy2 <- vector(mode="character", length=length(df3FinalDF$Year))

#FALSE if there is no discrepancy, TRUE if there is
#First Try
df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy1 <- ifelse(df3FinalDF$Year == df3FinalDF$YearReleased, FALSE, TRUE)

summary(df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy1)
summary(df3FinalDF$Gross)

df4First_try <- subset(df3FinalDF, df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy1 == FALSE)
df4First_tryTotalNrows <- nrow(df4First_try)
df4First_tryTotalNrows
df4First_try <- subset(df4First_try, !is.na(df4First_try$Gross))
df4First_tryGrossPresentNrows <- nrow(df4First_try)
df4First_tryGrossPresentNrows

df4First_tryPercent <- df4First_tryGrossPresentNrows / Original_gross_present
df4First_tryPercent
1 - df4First_tryPercent



#Second Try
df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy2 <- ifelse((df3FinalDF$Year == df3FinalDF$YearReleased |
                                      (df3FinalDF$Year + 1) == df3FinalDF$YearReleased |
                                      (df3FinalDF$Year - 1) == df3FinalDF$YearReleased), FALSE, TRUE)

summary(df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy2)
summary(df3FinalDF$Gross)

df4Second_try <- subset(df3FinalDF, df3FinalDF$YearDiscrepancy2 == FALSE)
df4Second_tryTotalNrows <- nrow(df4Second_try)
df4Second_tryTotalNrows
df4Second_try <- subset(df4Second_try, !is.na(df4Second_try$Gross))
df4Second_tryGrossPresentNrows <- nrow(df4Second_try)
df4Second_tryGrossPresentNrows

df4Second_tryPercent <- df4Second_tryGrossPresentNrows / Original_gross_present
df4Second_tryPercent
1 - df4Second_tryPercent


df4FinalDF <- df4Second_try


```

**Q**: What is your precise removal logic and how many rows did you end up removing?

**A**: 

## 5. Explore `Gross` revenue

For the commercial success of a movie, production houses want to maximize Gross revenue. Investigate if Gross revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre in any way.

Note: To get a meaningful relationship, you may have to partition the movies into subsets such as short vs. long duration, or by genre, etc.

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre
Genre_edited_names <- names(GBV_df)
df5Testp1 <- df4FinalDF
df5Testp1$RuntimeCut = cut(df5Testp1$Runtime, c(quantile(df5Testp1$Runtime, probs = seq(0, 1, by=0.20),
                                   na.rm=TRUE, include.lowest=TRUE, right=TRUE)))
df5Testp1$logGross <- log(df5Testp1$Gross)
df5Testp1C <- df5Testp1[,c("logGross", "BudgetRange", "RuntimeCut")]#, Genre_edited_names)]

ggpairs(df5Testp1C)


# df$BudgetRange = cut(df$Budget, c(quantile(df$Budget, probs = seq(0, 1, by=0.25),
#                                    na.rm=TRUE, include.lowest=TRUE, right=TRUE)),
#                      
                     
ggpairs(df5Testp1C)
names(df4FinalDF)
```

**Q**: Did you find any observable relationships or combinations of Budget/Runtime/Genre that result in high Gross revenue? If you divided the movies into different subsets, you may get different answers for them - point out interesting ones.

**A**: 

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Release Month
```

## 6. Process `Awards` column

The variable `Awards` describes nominations and awards in text format. Convert it to 2 numeric columns, the first capturing the number of wins, and the second capturing nominations. Replace the `Awards` column with these new columns, and then study the relationship of `Gross` revenue with respect to them.

Note that the format of the `Awards` column is not standard; you may have to use regular expressions to find the relevant values. Try your best to process them, and you may leave the ones that don't have enough information as NAs or set them to 0s.

```{r}
# TODO: Convert Awards to 2 numeric columns: wins and nominations
head(unique(df4FinalDF$Awards))

df6Test <- df4FinalDF

        }

    } else if (grepl('[0-9]+ win', dfAwardsCol[i])) {

        Wins[[i]] = Just_wins_num
    } else {
        Wins[[i]] = 0
    }
  }
  return(Wins)

## 7. Movie ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes

There are several variables that describe ratings, including IMDb ratings (`imdbRating` represents average user ratings and `imdbVotes` represents the number of user ratings), and multiple Rotten Tomatoes ratings (represented by several variables pre-fixed by `tomato`). Read up on such ratings on the web (for example [rottentomatoes.com/about](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about) and [ www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq](http:// www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq)).

Investigate the pairwise relationships between these different descriptors using graphs.

## 8. Ratings and awards

These ratings typically reflect the general appeal of the movie to the public or gather opinions from a larger body of critics. Whereas awards are given by professional societies that may evaluate a movie on specific attributes, such as artistic performance, screenplay, sound design, etc.

Study the relationship between ratings and awards using graphs (awards here refers to wins and/or nominations). 

```{r}
# TODO: Show how ratings and awards are related
```

**Q**: How good are these ratings in terms of predicting the success of a movie in winning awards or nominations? Is there a high correlation between two variables?

**A**: 

## 9. Expected insights

Come up with two new insights (backed up by data and graphs) that is expected. Here “new” means insights that are not an immediate consequence of one of the above tasks. You may use any of the columns already explored above or a different one in the dataset, such as `Title`, `Actors`, etc.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate two expected insights
